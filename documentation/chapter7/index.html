distinctive steps, viz. (1), constructing the geometrical data or
structure of the system (2), performing computations and, (3), obtaining
results by the post processing of calculated data. All these steps can
be effectively coupled by means of modeling platform such that a user
can create, visualize, and share various input data files and run it
with appropriate programs to obtain output data to analyze the results.</p><p>By integrating molecular (or crystal) visualizer, scripting tools (in
this case, Python and Jmol scripting) and other standard features of an
IDE (integrated development environment), a user can interactively build
or manipulate structures of materials or molecules, and its atomistic
properties can be calculated with appropriate ab initio programs from
either a local or a remote machine. A number of built-in tools, scripts
are provided for the analysis purpose. To demonstrate the platform we
have used DFTB+ as well as Siesta electronic structure code along with
ASE (atomic simulation environment) and OpenMD molecular dynamics
package.</p><p>   The programming language, Java (version 8) was chosen for this
project since it is free, strongly object-oriented and shows its
neutrality to the various operating systems. The object oriented
programming is arguably the most popular software development technique
which effectively manages the complexity in code development [9]. We
preferred Java, since (1) it does not use pointers, and (2), it supports
threads implicitly. Although pointers provide direct access to the
computer memory, careless use of the pointers will easily leads to
segmentation fault and other vulnerables. It is our personal opinion
that the bugs emerged from the improper application of pointers are
difficult to trace or debug, in addition to this, code with pointers is
difficult to translate into other computer languages without the pointer
features. Concerning threads, in this application, we used a number of
threads (i.e. user threads), apart from the JVM generated daemon
threads. Since the threads are inherently supported by the language one
can readily create a thread by extending a Thread class. Exception
handling of Java is equipped with two types, namely, unchecked and
checked exception handling. And in most of the cases we used checked
exceptions, as it is less tedious to implement.</p><p>   The core of the DJMol application consists of (Apache-) Netbeans
Platform and it can be regarded as the engine behind the Netbeans IDE.
In other words, many of the technical features of DJMol program is
inherited from Netbeans IDE which is initially designed for developing
Java/Javascript and C/C++ applications and consists a number of
utilities to increase the productivity of a user (for example, it has an
advanced sourcecode editor with code completion utilities, tools for
refactoring, version control systems, Git based collaboration tools
etc.) and these utilities can also be used efficiently for various
modeling or scripting tasks. Moreover, this platform consists of a set
of independent modular software components called modules (e.g., an SSH
module to communicate with an external cloud platform). Apart from this,
the program supports plug-ins so that one can selectively add or remove
new features into it (e.g. Python interpreter) without being re-compiled
the code. Optionally, users of the code can make their own plug-ins, for
example, to incorporate another ab initio package. See the below for the
schematic structure of the program. To the best of our knowledge, DJMol
is the first opensource modeling platform which is built from a
programming IDE.</p><p>To display the molecular, crystal, nanostructures a Java library, Jmol,
has been embedded into the program. The Jmol program is an open source,
cross-platform and a highly independent (i.e. it does not depend on any
third party libraries like Java3D or OpenGL) 3D visualization
application. Apart from this, there are two distinct features associated
with Jmol: (1) Jmol can be programmatically embedded into any Java code
which uses Swing application programming interface (2), It supports an
internal command scripting, so that a user can control or manipulate the
display or send and retrieve parameters, data, commands etc. For
example, to manipulate Gaussian cube files a user can effectively apply
this internal scripting ability of Jmol. Unlike most of the visualizers,
Jmol is capable of perceiving the molecular structure in three
dimensions by applying stereographic projections. A viewer, with
appropriate anaglyph spectacles, 3D perspective images of the molecules
can be interactively visualized. Apart from this, Jmol consists of an
UFF (uniform force field) method and it can be used to pre-optimize a
variety of organic as well as inorganic molecules. To create 2D data
plots we have used either Matplotlib based scripts or Jfreechart
libraries. In the case of 3D data plots, (for example, the potential
energy surfaces or orbital contour diagrams), a Java based opensource
library jzy3d has been used.</p><p><img src=/images/image24.png alt></p><p>Figure 7.1: A schematic diagram of DJMol software architecture. The core
