Demonstration of DJMol - 1

UV-Visible Spectrum of Silver Nanocluster using DFTB+

To demonstrate the basic functionality of the software, here we describe
how an UV-Visible spectrum of a silver nanocluster can be calculated
using DFTB+ code in conjunction with the DJMol software. There are three
steps to calculate the spectrum, viz. (1) Obtain the structure of Ag
nanocluster, (2) Optimize the structure and create the corresponding HSD
file for the TD-DFTB calculation and, (3) Plot the convoluted Spectrum
data. Note that we arbitrarily choose Ag 177 nanocluster (its diameter
is around 1.5 nm) for the TD-DFTB calculation. And the geometry of this
cluster is generated by OpenMD package  (in CygWin environment) by using
experimental lattice  constant of silver (4.08 A) and FCC lattice
structure. The following commands are used in the DJMol terminal to
obtain the Cartesian coordinate data of the system:


`cmd.exe /c  nanoparticleBuilder --latticeConstant=4.08 --radius=15 Ag.omd -o NP15.omd`
                                                                  
`cmd.exe /c  Dump2XYZ -i NP15.omd`


The resultant coordinate data (XYZ file), can be visualized by DJMol
program to generate a dftb_in.hsd file using the DFTB+ Script Writer
tool with appropriate settings, for example, by adding a conjugate
gradient method. See SetUp menu for this utility. This HSD file can be
then used to generate an optimized Ag 177 cluster by executing a DFTB+
calculation. It can be seen that this optimized cluster (See
geo_end.xyz file for the data) is approximately spherical in symmetry.
The optimized structure was again visualized and used in the Script
Writer tool to make another HSD file to include instructions for Casida
method (a TD-DFTB algorithm).  The essential part of this script is:

```                      
ExcitedState = Casida {     
    NrOfExcitations=100     
    StateOfInterest=0       
    Symmetry=singlet        
    WriteTransitions=no     
    WriteSPTransitions=yes  
    WriteMulliken=no        
    WriteCoefficients=no    
    WriteEigenvectors=no    
    WriteTransitionDipole=no
    OscillatorWindow=0.01   
}                           
```

In all the DFTB calculation, we used hyb-0-2 parameter set is used for
the silver atoms. This newly generated HSD file is submitted to a remote
Linux machine using the SSH utility (See Extra menu in the tool bar) of
the DJMol and after finishing the calculation a SPX output file was
retrieved in the local machine, which contains the oscillator strengths
of different electronic excitations. It was then plotted with UV-Vis
spectrum from the Tool menu to obtain the spectrum of the molecule. A
Lorentzian convolution (with 0.035 eV of full width at half maximum) is
used to obtain the spectrum as shown in the Fig.X. Note that the
absorption maximum wavelength (λmax) is located around 440 nm i.e.
around the indigo-blue region. By plotting molecular orbital energy
levels (using MOLevels tool and with the detailed.out file) one can seen
that the Fermi level is near to 3.9 eV and band gap of this cluster is
negligibly small (See the inset figure in Fig. X). And it qualitatively
indicates that Ag177  behaves like a semi-metal.

Different sized nanoparticles can be constructed by applying the above
said method to study red shift property of the system. See the Fig.XX.
Experimentally this is a known fact for the Ag n system (By comparing
λmax values of clusters, we can seen that, λ max  shifts towards UV
region if we increase the size of the nano clusters.). This can be
qualitatively justified by particle in a box  analogy. Note that the
diameter of Ag 177 is longer than that of the Ag13 so that its electron
can move longer along its diameter (the box   length). This will reduce
its ΔE values significantly (by increasing the size of the diameter of a
silver cluster, a photon from the red  region - a wavelength that
corresponds to a lower energy - can cause an electronic excitation). For
experimental UV-Vis spectra, see:

Frontier Orbitals of C60 Calculated with Siesta

Volumetric MO data can be made by using executing steps described in
Denchar Utility, systematically using the Siesta add-on. The Siesta
add-on can be invoked by:  

Execute ➤ Siesta Calculator

In this section we shall obtain the frontier orbitals of Buckminster
fullerene. See the example file Fullerene.fdf under the Siesta_Samples
folder for its coordinate (note that it is an un-optimized structure;
its optimization procedure is left to the user as an additional
exercise).  Since we used a molecular system in a unit cell, the default
k-point ( Γ-point) is used to represent electronic wavefunction
coefficients. Note that HOMO and LUMO coefficients are at 120 and 121’th
k-points. See the Siesta Manual for more details.

And change the main setting of the fdf file as (ie. except the
coordinate as it is inserted between,

From this we can seen that, a double zeta type basis is used along with
the PBE functional for the DFT calculation. A cubic box of 25 Å lengths
is used to place the molecule.

Run the calculation as usual and after finishing the run, plot MO energy
levels, using MO Energies, which also indicate the level of HOMO (from
the first occupied level, which is level 1):

execute its next step, which is Run Denchar. After finishing View 2D/3D

OpenMD MD simulation of Gold-nanoparticle

In this demonstration, we would obtain the gold-gold atom pair
distribution function from the OpenMD molecular dynamics trajectory. One
can open OpenMD tool by:

In first we have to construct a Au-nanoparticle (with
icosahedron symmetry). A basic starting script for the calculation is
given below (its file name is gold.omd, and note HTML styled tags in it)

```

Using the command (in the OpenMD tool’s command shell window) save the
file, gold.omd ,with the above data.

`cmd.exe /c notepad.exe gold.omd`

Then run the following commands one after another:

`cmd.exe /c .\\icosahedralBuilder.exe  -o file.omd --shell=8 --latticeConstant=4.08 --ico gold.omd`

`cmd.exe /c Dump2XYZ -i file.omd`

`cmd.exe /c more file.xyz`

If everything is correct you will get a gold-nanoparticle structure as
shown in the below figure-a. The above procedure construct a file
called, file.omd which contains all the XYZ data of the nanoparticle.

However in order to start an MD run, we need initial velocities. For the
purpose please run the command:

`cmd.exe /c .\\thermalizer -t 5 -o file-5K.omd file.omd`

It will create a new file, file-5K.omd with new initial velovities and 5
Kelvin as its target temperature. Its main parameters are:

```
forceField = "SC";                                                 
forceFieldFileName = "SuttonChen.QSC.frc";                         
ensemble = "LHull";                                                
targetTemp = 5;                                                    
targetPressure = 1;                                                
viscosity = 0.1;                                                   
dt = 2.0;                                                          
runTime = 2E5;                                                     
sampleTime = 500.0;                                                
statusTime = 4;                                                    
seed = 985456376;                                                  
usePeriodicBoundaryConditions = "false";                           
tauThermostat = 1E3;                                               
tauBarostat = 5E3;                                                 
```

Then run the actual OpenMD molecular dynamics run as,

`cmd.exe /c openmd file-5K.omd`

This may take a while (2 hour), and its trajectory information will
stored in the dump file. From this MD animation can be retrived as:

`cmd.exe /c Dump2XYZ -b  -i file-5K.dump`

Moreover, from the below figure one can see that the 5K thermalization
is achieved in the MD run (note its convergence to 5K)

![ ](/images/image52.png%20 " ")

After that, a script utility to retrieve, gAu-Au((r), as:

`cmd.exe /c StaticProps.exe -i file-5K.dump --gofr --sele1="select Au*" --sele2="select Au*"`

![ ](/images/image53.png%20 " ")

trajectory data which use only test-level parameters. Note the
similarity with g(r) obtained by a hard-sphere model (inset figure

ASE simulation of an adatom diffusion

Here we use ASE to obtain the energy profile of a physical process -
diffusion of an adatom or adsorbed atom (Au) on the top of a metallic
surface of Al atoms. Nudged elastic band (NEB) method is used for the
calculation, in which an initial structure (where an adatom i.e. gold
atom is placed in the left side) and a final structure (adatom is placed
in the right side) of the process is used as its input data. For more
details please visit ASE tutorial web page. Note that we used EMT
calculators (it is a really fast albeit highly approximated potential
function) for this calculation however one can use Siesta within ASE to
obtain more realistic diffusion barrier.

Refer Chapter-5 for creating a Python Project. Then add an Empty
module (InitialFinalStructure.py fie) into the src  directory. Then add
the following Python source into it:

```python
from ase.build import fcc100, add_adsorbate     
from ase.constraints import FixAtoms             
from ase.calculators.emt import EMT              
from ase.optimize import QuasiNewton             
# 3x3-Al(001) surface with 3 layers and an      
# Au atom adsorbed in a hollow site:            
slab = fcc100('Al', size=(3, 3, 3))              
add_adsorbate(slab, 'Au', 1.7, 'hollow')        
slab.center(axis=2, vacuum=4.0)                  
# Fix second and third layers:                  
mask = [atom.tag > 1 for atom in slab]          
slab.set_constraint(FixAtoms(mask=mask))        
# Use EMT potential:                            
slab.calc = EMT()                                
# Initial state:                                
qn = QuasiNewton(slab, trajectory='initial.traj')
qn.run(fmax=0.05)                                
# Final state:                                  
slab[-1].x += slab.get_cell()[0, 0] / 3         
qn = QuasiNewton(slab, trajectory='final.traj')  
qn.run(fmax=0.05)                                
```

Then Run the file (Run ► Run File). This will create, initial.traj and
final.traj files which contains the initial and final structure
respectively.

After this, the NEB calculation can be started (don’t forget to create a
new Python file for this) and its Python source is given below:

```python

The energy profile can be saved in a PNG image by using the following
script:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                                     
from ase.neb import NEBTools                                        
from ase.io import read                                             
images = read('neb.traj@-11:')                                      
nebtools = NEBTools(images)                                         
# Get the calculated barrier and the energy change of the reaction.
Ef, dE = nebtools.get_barrier()                                    
# Get the barrier without any interpolation between highest images.
Ef, dE = nebtools.get_barrier(fit=False)                           
# Get the actual maximum force at this point in the simulation.    
max_force = nebtools.get_fmax()                                   
# Create a figure like that coming from ASE-GUI.                   
fig = nebtools.plot_band()                                         
fig.savefig('diffusion-barrier.png')                                
# Create a figure with custom parameters.                          
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(5.5, 4.0))                                
ax = fig.add_axes((0.15, 0.15, 0.8, 0.75))                         
nebtools.plot_band(ax)                                             
fig.savefig('diffusion-barrier.png')                                
```

Finally, the neb.traj file, which contains the entire geometry of the
process in binary format, is then used to obtain XYZ format by the
following script:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                      
from ase.calculators.emt import EMT                  
from ase.neb import NEB                              
from ase.optimize import BFGS                        
from ase.io import read, write                       
import os                                            
                                                     
# read the last structures (of 5 images used in NEB)
images = read('neb.traj@-11:')                       
for i in range(0,  len(images)):                     
    atoms = images[i]                                
    #print(atoms.get_positions())                  
    write('delete.xyz', atoms)                       
    inFile = open(os.path.join( 'delete.xyz'), 'r')  
    fileStr = inFile.read()                          
    outFile = open("neb_movie.xyz", 'a')            
    outFile.write(fileStr)    

# @type outFile                                     
outFile.close()                                      
inFile.close()                                       
```

Additionally, using DJMol's xyz File loader (File►Open Structure) the
geometries of the process as it is saved in "neb_movie.xyz" can be
displayed or animated (See the below figure).
