UV-Visible Spectrum of Silver Nanocluster using DFTB+
------------------------------------------------------

To demonstrate the basic functionality of the software, here we describe how an UV-Visible spectrum of a 
silver nanocluster can be calculated using DFTB+ code in conjunction with the DJMol software. 
There are three steps to calculate the spectrum, viz. (1) Obtain the structure of Ag nanocluster, (2) 
Optimize the structure and create the corresponding HSD file for the TD-DFTB calculation and, (3) 
Plot the convoluted Spectrum data. Note that we arbitrarily choose Ag177 nanocluster (its diameter is 
around 1.5 nm) for the TD-DFTB calculation. And the geometry of this cluster is generated by OpenMD 
package  (in CygWin environment) by using experimental lattice constant of silver (4.08 A) and FCC 
lattice structure. 

The following commands are used in the DJMol terminal to obtain the Cartesian 
coordinate data of the system:

.. code:: bash

    cmd.exe /c  nanoparticleBuilder --latticeConstant=4.08 --radius=15 Ag.omd -o NP15.omd
    cmd.exe /c  Dump2XYZ -i NP15.omd 

The resultant coordinate data (XYZ file), can be visualized by DJMol program to generate a dftb_in.hsd 
file using the DFTB+ Script Writer tool with appropriate settings, for example, by adding a 
conjugate gradient method. See SetUp menu for this utility. This HSD file can be then used to 
generate an optimized Ag177 cluster by executing a DFTB+ calculation. It can be seen that this 
optimized cluster (See geo_end.xyz file for the data) is approximately spherical in symmetry. The 
optimized structure was again visualized and used in the Script Writer tool to make another HSD file 
to include instructions for Casida method (a TD-DFTB algorithm).  

The essential part of this script is:

.. code:: bash

    . .
    ExcitedState = Casida {
        NrOfExcitations=100
        StateOfInterest=0
        Symmetry=singlet
        WriteTransitions=no
        WriteSPTransitions=yes
        WriteMulliken=no
        WriteCoefficients=no
        WriteEigenvectors=no
        WriteTransitionDipole=no
        OscillatorWindow=0.01
    }
    . . .

In all the DFTB calculation, we used hyb-0-2 parameter set is used for the silver atoms. 
This newly generated HSD file is submitted to a remote Linux machine using the SSH utility 
(See Extra menu in the tool bar) of the DJMol and after finishing the calculation a SPX output 
file was retrieved in the local machine, which contains the oscillator strengths of different 
electronic excitations. It was then plotted with UV-Vis spectrum from the Tool menu to obtain the 
spectrum of the molecule. A Lorentzian convolution (with 0.035 eV of full width at half maximum) is 
used to obtain the spectrum as shown in the Figure Below. Note that the absorption maximum wavelength (:math:`\lambda_{max}`) 
is located around 440 nm i.e. around the indigo-blue region. By plotting molecular orbital energy 
levels (using MOLevels tool and with the detailed.out file) one can seen that the Fermi level is 
near to 3.9 eV and band gap of this cluster is negligibly small (See the inset figure in Fig. below). 
And it qualitatively indicates that :math:`Ag_{177}` behaves like a semi-metal.

Different sized nanoparticles can be constructed by applying the above said method to 
study red shift property of the system. See the Figure below. Experimentally this is a known fact for 
the Agn system (By comparing :math:`\lambda_{max}` values of clusters, we can seen that, :math:`\lambda_{max}` shifts towards UV 
region if we increase the size of the nano clusters.). This can be qualitatively justified by 
particle in a box analogy. Note that the diameter of :math:`Ag_{177}` is longer than that of the :math:`Ag_{13}` so 
that its electron can move longer along its diameter (the box length). This will reduce its :math:`\Delta E` 
values significantly (by increasing the size of the diameter of a silver cluster, a photon from 
the red region - a wavelength that corresponds to a lower energy - can cause an electronic excitation).
