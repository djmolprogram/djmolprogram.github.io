Chapter 1: Introduction
========================
DJMol is an ongoing open source (licensed with GPL v3 or later) ‘Modeling Platform’ project and 
it is architectured for performing various simulations in computational materials science / chemistry. 
It is a free, object-oriented software developed by IKST, (Indo-Korea Science and Technology Centre, 
17/1, Bellary Rd, Yashoda Nagar, Yelahanka, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560064), Bangalore.

In its core level, DJMol is integrated with widely accepted and open source (GPL/LGPL ) 
computational software, such as,
DFTB+ (University of Bremen, Germany), the default calculator of DJMol
Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE, Technical University of Denmark)
SIESTA (Institut de Ciencia de Materials de Barcelona (ICMAB), Spain)
OpenMD (University of Notre Dame., USA).

The main target of this software is the researchers (including experimentalists) 
and academicians and industrial researchers. In addition to this, a site, 
https://sites.google.com/view/djmolplatform is created for more technical details, 
updates and demonstration videos/notes etc. The code-development resources are recently included in its official site, www.djmol.info .

As mentioned before, the software is integrated with DFTB+ (as its default calculator), 
and Siesta (for higher level DFT calculations), along with ASE and OpenMD,. Hence a short review 
on these packages is added for a quick-reference.
Computational Tools

Here, a short overview of the four main components of the platform is described.

DFTB+: DFTB (Density functional tight binding) method is an electronic structure method which is specially 
designed to model large molecular/crystal/nano-systems. The origin of this method is routed in DFT 
itself, which is, arguably, the most popular ab initio method in computational materials science or 
in quantum chemistry. It is developed in 80’s and it has been introduced into the computational 
chemistry area mainly by work of Prof. Helmut Eschrig, Prof. Gotthard Seifert, and Prof. T
homas Frauenheim et. al. Since it uses DFT parameters, DFTB is also known as approximate DFT method.

This method uses atomic parameters (as it is stored in the SK file set, a text file) 
which are generated from highly accurate atomic DFT calculations using PBE functional. 
It also consists of diatomic repulsive potentials from B3LYP functional. Note that DFTB+ 
uses minimal valence basis set (numerical Slater type AOs) and one has to explicitly specify a 
particular SK data file for a given calculation.

A list of SK file set list is given below (see, www.dftb.org), which is by default, 
added in the DJMol suite. Other SK file which are not included (such as, <3ob:freq> set 
which requires <3ob>) should manually incorporate into their input scripts (it is freely available);
