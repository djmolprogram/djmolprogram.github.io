[{"uri":"https://djmolprogram.github.io/","title":"DJMol Docs","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Welcome to DJMol Modeling Platform DJMol is an open source (GPL v3), free, Object-oriented Modeling Platform specially designed for Computational Materials Science and Computational Chemistry. At present it is integrated with DFTB+ (default modeling engine), along with Siesta, OpenMD, and ASE Python interpreter. At present, it is available for windows 64-bit OS and soon it will be updated for Linux 64-bit OS, with more additions like, NWChem, Huckel Calculators, Reaction rate modules\nSome of the Tasks* that DJMol can Perform/Analyze/Calculate is:\n DFTB+ or Siesta Molecular/Nano system calculations Visualization of Orbitals, Partial Charges, / (projected-) Density of states, Band structures Viewing Phonon/IR modes, Intensities (including velocity auto-correlation via Fast Fourier Transform), UV-Vis Spectra (i.e. Time Dependent DFTB) Python scripting with ASE (Transition State Search/ Reaction Path) Vibrational Modes Molecular dynamics/Trajectories Symmetry of Structure, 2D, 1D Potential energy surfaces Generate Nano-/Molecular Structures, and its Conversions Cloud based remote computing (SSH) etc.   The DJMol project evolved under the leadership of Dr.Krishna Mohan G. P., (Asst. Prof. of Chemistry, Department of Science and Humanities, Mar Baselios College of Science and Technology (MBCET), Trivandrum, Kerala, India: 695015, Rahul Sunil (BTech in Computer Science, MBCET), Dr. Kapil Gupta and Dr. Seung C Lee (Indo-Korea Science and Technology Center, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India: 560064). The program is developed by IKST, Bengaluru, India.\n Documentation DJMol\u0026rsquo;s online manual is available here. PDF manual is also available.\nDownload and Installation For getting the source code and compiling instruction click here\nMailing List We strongly encourage DJMol users to join its users forum. Please visit https://djmol.forumotion.com/ to join the Forum\nLicense The Program is distributed under GPL-v3 (or later). For a detailed review on this license visit GNU Project\nContact Mail krishna.mohan@mbcet.ac.in or krishnamohan.gp@gmail.com for further queries on the program.\n"},{"uri":"https://djmolprogram.github.io/installation/","title":"Installation","tags":[],"description":"","content":"DJMol Download and Installation  Download   Binaries   Source   For Compiling/Installation of DJMol and Add-Ons General Information A familiarity with programming using Netbeans IDE is assumed. All of the DJMol Program was compiled by using Netbeans IDE, v 8.2 (64bit) in Windows 64 OS.\n   The needed Packages are:     JAVA 1.8 (jdk-8u201-windows-x64.exe) Netbeans 8.2 (netbeans-8.2-javaee-windows.exe) Python plug-in (2017-08-29-nbpython-nbms.zip) Python 3.7.2 (python-3.7.2-amd64.exe) Pip script (get-pip.py) Numpy (numpy-1.16.0+mkl-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl)     We also used (64 bit) the following Python packages with version numbers:     SciPy (scipy 1.2.1) ASE (ASE 3.17.0) Matplotlib (Matplotlib 3.0.3)   And these modules can be downloaded by using pip (use pip3).\n    A. Compiling Main Program     Open the Project Directory, DJmol Platform v2.1 and Compile and Build DJMol program. See the YouTube channel for its demonstration. Then make a Zip Distribution (by Selecting project DJmol Platform v2.1 followed by selecting Package as, Zip Distribution). A new dist folder will be created and it holds the Zip file.     B. Installing Program    Go to dist folder and unzip the file and Copy all the files/folders from the Auxiliary folder into *** dist\\djmolplatform1***. This is shown in the demonstration. Go to dist\\djmolplatform1\\etc and replace the following line in the djmolplatform1.CONF file: default_options=\u0026quot;--branding djmolplatform1 -J-Xms24m -J-Xmx64m\u0026quot;  to default_options=\u0026quot;--branding djmolplatform1 -J-Xms240m -J-Xmx640m\u0026quot; To adjust the Resolution of the program Right click on djmolplatform164.exe then move to Compatibility tab and click on *** Change high DPI settings*** and Select the option \u0026ldquo;Override high DPI scaling behavior\u0026rdquo;. Follow the instruction in the PathVariablesSetting.pdf file.  DJMol program can be now simply executed by double clicking djmolplatform164.exe which is located in bin folder.\nNote that for the First Time of the execution, you may want to select, Disable Modules and Continue option. To fix this, you can try to clean your user-directory as it is mentioned in http://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqWhatIsUserdir\nAnd once the application starts do the following (not mandate but it is useful):\nClose \u0026lt;Start Page\u0026gt; Close \u0026lt;Services\u0026gt; Add \u0026lt;Windows -\u0026gt; Favorites\u0026gt; Add \u0026lt;Windows -\u0026gt; Output\u0026gt;    C. Compiling Add-On Programs    See AddOns_compilation.txt in Add-On directory.\n"},{"uri":"https://djmolprogram.github.io/installation/requirements/","title":"System Requirements","tags":[],"description":"","content":"DJMol System Requirements   Software:\n Windows 10-7 64 bit OS Java 1.8 or later, Python 3.x    Hardware:\n At least 20 GB free space to install DJMol and add-ons.
